# CRE-Debt-Solana: Project Overview

## Vision
To create a Solana-based DeFi platform that enables commercial real estate owners to access up to 90% of their property equity through debt instruments, providing faster access to capital and higher LTV ratios than traditional lenders, while maintaining full ownership of their assets.

## Problem Statement
Commercial property owners with significant equity face lengthy, expensive processes when attempting to access capital through traditional financial institutions. Current solutions typically:
- Cap loans at 65-75% LTV
- Involve extensive paperwork and slow approval processes (often 60-90 days)
- Require costly appraisals and due diligence
- Leave substantial equity inaccessible unless owners turn to expensive hard money loans

This inefficiency creates opportunity costs and prevents property owners from leveraging their assets effectively for business growth, additional acquisitions, or operational needs.

## Solution
Our Solana-based platform revolutionizes commercial real estate equity access by:
- Enabling higher LTV ratios (up to 90%)
- Accelerating the approval and funding process
- Utilizing smart contracts for loan origination and servicing
- Disbursing funds as stablecoins (USDC) for immediate utility
- Maintaining pure debt structure to avoid securities regulations
- Creating a marketplace connecting property owners with institutional lenders

## Key Differentiators
1. **First-mover on Solana for CRE debt**: Pioneering the intersection of DeFi and commercial real estate lending on Solana
2. **Higher LTV than traditional finance**: Access to 90% LTV compared to traditional 65-75%
3. **Speed and efficiency**: Faster processing through blockchain automation
4. **Stablecoin integration**: Immediate access to funds in USDC
5. **Pure debt structure**: Avoiding securities regulations by structuring as traditional debt instruments
6. **Wyoming legal framework**: Smart contract recognition and crypto-friendly regulations

## Target Users

### Property Owners

## Regulatory Strategy
- Register in Wyoming to leverage smart contract recognition and crypto-friendly regulations

- Servicing fees (25-50 bps annually)
- Platform fees for lenders (future)
- Interest spread between borrowers and lenders (future)

## Success Metrics
