# CRE-Debt-Solana: Technical Architecture

## System Overview

The CRE-Debt-Solana platform consists of several integrated components working together to enable commercial real estate owners to access equity through blockchain-based debt instruments.

## Core Components

### 1. Smart Contract System

The platform's backbone consists of Solana-based smart contracts written in Rust using the Anchor framework. These contracts handle:

#### Loan Origination Contract
- Manages the creation of new loans
- Handles collateral validation
- Enforces LTV ratio limits
- Manages loan terms (duration, interest rate, payment schedule)
- Ensures proper KYC/AML verification before approval

#### Loan Servicing Contract
- Tracks and processes loan repayments
- Handles interest calculations
- Manages late payments and penalties
- Triggers default procedures when necessary

#### Stablecoin Integration
- Interfaces with USDC for loan disbursements and repayments
- Manages escrow functionality for funds
- Handles treasury operations for platform fees

#### Lender Marketplace (Future Phase)
- Manages lender participation and commitments
- Handles loan syndication and participation
- Implements risk tranching for institutional lenders

### 2. Backend Services

A set of off-chain services that support the blockchain functionality:

#### Property Valuation Service
- Integrates with third-party data providers for CRE valuations
- Implements AI algorithms for property value assessment
- Calculates appropriate LTV ratios based on property characteristics
- Monitors market conditions for ongoing valuation updates

#### KYC/AML Service
- Verifies borrower identity and credentials
- Performs sanctions screening
- Implements risk-based compliance procedures
- Maintains compliance records for regulatory requirements

#### Document Generation System
- Creates UCC filing documentation
- Generates loan agreements and term sheets
- Produces borrower disclosure documents
- Creates legal backup documentation for smart contracts

#### Analytics Engine
- Tracks platform metrics and performance
- Monitors loan performance and risk metrics
- Provides reporting for regulatory compliance
- Offers insights for product improvement

### 3. User Interfaces

#### Borrower Portal
- Account creation and management
- Property submission and valuation
- Loan application process
- Document uploads for verification
- Loan management and repayment dashboard
- Stablecoin wallet integration

#### Admin Dashboard
- Loan approval workflow
- Risk management tools
- Compliance monitoring
- System health monitoring
- Analytics and reporting

#### Lender Portal (Future Phase)
- Investment opportunities listing
- Commitment management
- Portfolio performance tracking
- Risk assessment tools

## Data Flows

### Loan Origination Process
1. Borrower creates account and completes KYC verification
2. Borrower submits property details for valuation
3. Valuation service assesses property and determines allowable LTV
4. Borrower selects loan terms (amount, duration, etc.)
5. System generates loan documents and smart contract
6. Borrower signs documents and approves smart contract
7. Funds are disbursed to borrower's wallet in USDC
8. UCC filings are automatically generated and submitted

### Loan Servicing Process
1. Smart contract tracks loan payment schedule
2. Borrower receives notifications for upcoming payments
3. Borrower sends USDC payments to contract address
4. Contract processes payment, updates loan status
5. Platform fees are extracted and distributed
6. Late payment triggers are monitored and activated if needed
7. Loan performance data is recorded for analytics

### Default Handling Process
1. Smart contract identifies missed payments beyond grace period
2. Automated notifications are sent to borrower
3. Default procedures are initiated per loan agreement
4. Legal documentation is generated for enforcement
5. Workout options are presented when applicable
6. UCC foreclosure process is initiated if necessary
