## Team Communication and Coordination

- Daily standup meetings (15-30 minutes)
- End-of-phase reviews (longer sessions at days 10, 20, 27)
- Shared communication channel for ongoing discussions
- Code reviews for all pull requests
- Documentation updates as features are completed

## Critical Success Factors

- **MVP Focus**: Prioritize a working loan origination and servicing flow over feature completeness
- **Technical Simplicity**: Avoid over-engineering; focus on readable, maintainable code
- **Realistic Scope**: Be prepared to cut non-essential features to meet the timeline
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation throughout development
- **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing from the beginning

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Team member unavailability | Cross-train team members on critical components |
| Technical challenges | Identify fallback approaches for complex features |
| Scope creep | Maintain a prioritized backlog and be willing to defer features |
| Integration issues | Focus on integration points early in development |
| Performance issues | Design with scalability in mind and test early |

## Post-Hackathon Planning

The following activities should be planned for immediately after the hackathon:

- Security audit from a professional third party
- Legal review of regulatory compliance
- Further development of institutional lender integration
- Enhancement of valuation models
- Scaling infrastructure for production deployment

This workplan provides a structured approach to developing the CRE-Debt-Solana platform within the 30-day hackathon timeframe while maintaining flexibility to adapt as needed.
